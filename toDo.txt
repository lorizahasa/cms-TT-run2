Skim:
# Include UL signal samples
# Include 2018 UL datasets including fix for high pT muons

Ntuple:
#Add Weight_jer for AK8
# Update the DY_Enriched selection where we require the two muons of opposite 
charge and mass window in 91.18+-10 GeV
# Apply electron HLT Zvtx sf = 0.991 for 2017
# It seems we have to evaluate electron Trigger SFs using TnP method for UL samples
# Document details about PDF, ISR/FSR systematics in the AN
# Describe HEM veto in the AN
# The Q2 unc is around 25%. Double check it
# Why TTGamma hadronic sample has smaller xss compared to semilep?
# Add many new variables for MVA based on H -> cc

MVA:
Define two CRb inverting the b-tag requirment

Plot:
Add stat unc in the ratioSyst plots

HistMain:
## The integral of Jet_pt (30 bins) differs with Jet_eta. However, with 300 bins,
it matches. Similar for Jet_mass. Don't really understand it.
## Include TTGamma CPTune up/down in the limit computation
## Why TTGamma and Others lumiSF is different for muon and electron channel
