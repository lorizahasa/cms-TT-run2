Skim:
# Include UL signal samples
# Include 2018 UL datasets including fix for high pT muons
# Remove VFP from the name of years

Ntuple:
#Add Weight_jer for AK8
# Document details about PDF, ISR/FSR systematics in the AN
# The Q2 unc is around 25%. Double check it
# Why TTGamma hadronic sample has smaller xss compared to semilep?

MVA:
Include additional QCD (15 to 30) and GJets (100HT200) in the sample list
Define two CRb inverting the b-tag requirment

Plot:
Add stat unc in the ratioSyst plots

#------------------- UL --------------------
HistMain:
## OrderedDict for control regions
## The integral of Jet_pt (30 bins) differs with Jet_eta. However, with 300 bins,
it matches. Similar for Jet_mass. Don't really understand it.
## Include TTGamma CPTune up/down in the limit computation
## Why TTGamma and Others lumiSF is different for muon and electron channel

#Check the trigger efficiencies when we have 2 muons:
